Sherlock-and-Squares
======
##Description##
Watson gives two integers (_A_ and _B_) to Sherlock and asks if he can count the number of square integers between _A_ and _B_ (both inclusive).

**Note**: A square integer is an integer which is the square of any integer. For example, 1, 4, 9, and 16 are some of the square integers as they are square of 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively.

###Input Format###
The first line contains _T_, the number of test cases. _T_ test cases follow, each in a new line. Each test case contains two space-separated integers denoting _A_ and _B_.

###Output Format###
For each test case, print the required answer in a new line.

####Constraints####
```
1 <= T <= 100
1 <= A <= B <= 10^9
```

###Sample Input###
```
2
3 9
17 24
```

###Sample Output###
```
2
0
```

###Explanation###
Test Case 1: In range [3, 9], 4 and 9 are the two square numbers.
Test Case 2: In range [17, 24], there are no square numbers.
